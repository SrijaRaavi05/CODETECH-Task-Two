OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

Project: Finite State Machine (FSM) Design

Objective:
	Designed the moore and mealy machine in Verilog using vlsi software environment. 
 
Key Activities:
	An example of moore machine, which is a cyclic lamp has been designed. The output is mainly depended upon the present input. If the input is 3’h4, the output will be red, if the input is 3’h2, the output will be green, and if the input is 3’h1, the output will be yellow.
	An example of mealy machine, which is sequence detector of (0110) has been designed. The output is dependent upon the present input and previous state. The input sequence is directly fed into the mealy machine, the output raises high when the desired sequence is detected. 
 
Technology Used: Xilinx vivado 2024.1 software.
